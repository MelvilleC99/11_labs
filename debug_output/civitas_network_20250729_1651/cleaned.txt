=== ABOUT PAGE (https://www.civitas.network/about) ===
Who is Civitas Become a member Helping founders succeed We believe that founders are a force for good in the world. They build, create jobs, raise living standards, pay taxes, and solve problems. -That‚Äôs why we've been obsessed with one question: how can we help founders succeed? More successful companies = a better world. Our search for answers led us to a range of studies that showed that if a founder 1. Get funded by aworld-classs accelerator, 2. Joined a top CEO network or 3. Belonging to the right community or tribe, drastically improved their odds of success The problem? Most founders don‚Äôt have access to these communities. Our mission was to create a community that was a mash up of Y Combinator (the world top accelerator), Young Presidents organisation (the world‚Äôs largest CEO network), and a wealthy entrepreneurial family and make it radically affordable to anyone who had the potential of building a $100 million dollar company. 'We believed if we could do this we could significantly increase the number of founders that were able to build companies that impacted the world. We have been doing this for 5 years, helping founders reach major milestones. Along the way, some of the smartest founders have enriched our community by sharing their success stories. If you‚Äôre ready to learn from their experiences and contribute your own, join us. Let‚Äôs build something amazing together.
