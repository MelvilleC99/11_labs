=== ABOUT PAGE (https://www.civitas.network/about) ===
Who is Civitas Become a member Helping founders succeed We believe that founders are a force for good in the world. They build, create jobs, raise living standards, pay taxes, and solve problems. -That’s why we've been obsessed with one question: how can we help founders succeed? More successful companies = a better world. Our search for answers led us to a range of studies that showed that if a founder 1. Get funded by aworld-classs accelerator, 2. Joined a top CEO network or 3. Belonging to the right community or tribe, drastically improved their odds of success The problem? Most founders don’t have access to these communities.
